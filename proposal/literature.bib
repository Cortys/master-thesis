  abstract    = {We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract      = {We deal with two independent but related problems, those of graph similarity and subgraph matching, which are both important practical problems useful in several fields of science, engineering and data analysis. For the problem of graph similarity, we develop and test a new framework for solving the problem using belief propagation and related ideas. For the subgraph matching problem, we develop a new algorithm based on existing techniques in the bioinformatics and data mining literature, which uncover periodic or infrequent matchings. We make substantial progress compared to the existing methods for both problems.},
